                <p>Yaayyy, I recieved a mail congratulating me that I've been selected for the Andela Bootcamp cycle LOS 34. </p>
                <p>Okay, so I'm all excited. The email says I'll be getting a pre-bootcamp challenge, that shouldn't be a problem  - I thought to myself. 
                The email with the challenge came in as promised, I opened it, downloaded the document containing the challenge and boom I saw two challenges to be delivered before the bootcamp onboarding day 
                with each challenge taking a duration of 1 week which makes a total of 2 weeks for both challenge.</p>   
                <p>After scanning through the challenge I became overwhelmed in no time but then just like the morning dew it dawned on me that if truly I want to be a world class developer I need to be able to
                confidently take on challenges with the mindset that I have no option but to deliver and not just deliver but deliver well</p>
                <p>So, I closed the document opened it again but this time with the mindset that it is something I can do. For the most part writing the code wasn't a problem but the tools! From version control to testing to Continous integration</p>
